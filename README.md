# GymNote
 
## An overview
The idea for GymNote was born from an issue I face while recording the details of workouts I do at the gym. My programming is supplied through an app but this app does not have a note taking feature or ability to log something as you go. You need to log and submit your workouts in one go. I had previously been using the notes app on my iphone but that’s not ideal as those notes are mixed in with other general notes.
A solution was to create the GymNote app which would house my notes before I submit them online. 
All user logins and user data will be stored in a Firebase Realtime Database

## The problem it solves
Each user has a login on the app and once logged in they will be able to create a new note, save and update it and view their notes. Each note will be created as ‘incomplete’ and will remain in that state until the user submits it to their own chosen final location. This could be in a notebook, to a personal trainer or another app/website. 
For me, my notes will be incomplete until I log them onto a website or another app.
